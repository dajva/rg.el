     rg.el 2.3.0, Apr 30, 2023

     David Landell

     Copyright © 2019, David Landell

`rg.el' is an Emacs search package based on the ripgrep
(https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) command line tool.  It allows
you to interactively create searches, doing automatic searches based on
the editing context, refining and modifying search results and much
more.  It is also highly configurable to be able to fit different users’
needs.

Throughout this manual this emacs package will be referred to as `rg'
while the command line utility will be referred to as `ripgrep'.

If you are used to built-in Emacs ‘rgrep’ command, transitioning to `rg'
should be simple.  `rg' provides a lot of extra features but the basics
are similar.

The big benefit of using `ripgrep' instead of `grep' as a backend is
speed.  Especially when searching large source code repositories where
`ripgrep' really shines.  Please read this blog post
(http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/) for some speed comparisons with
other tools.

1.1 Installation
================

This version of `rg' is supported on GNU Emacs 26.1 or later on Linux
systems.  It might work on older Emacsen and on other systems but such
configurations are not tested.  Patches for other OS:es are welcome.

MELPA
.....

Packages are published on MELPA Stable (https://stable.melpa.org/#/rg)
and MELPA (http://melpa.org/#/rg).  From within Emacs, run ‘M-x
package-install [RET] rg [RET]’ to install from those sources.

Enable default key bindings:

     (rg-enable-default-bindings)

The above will enable the default key map ‘rg-menu’ under the default
prefix key ‘C-c s’.

Manual
......

Releases can alternatively be downloaded from GitHub
(https://github.com/dajva/rg.el/releases/latest) and installed manually.
Put all elisp files in main directory in your load path and ‘require’
the package in your init file.

     (require 'rg)
     (rg-enable-default-bindings)

You would also need to make sure all package requirements are met.  For
this version these are:

   - `wgrep' 2.1.10

   - `transient' 0.3.0

   - `emacs' 26.1

`rg' is using autoloaded symbols which means it’s also possible to defer
loading if you have autoloading setup.  That usually comes out of the
box with ‘package-install’.

Lazy loading
............

For lazy loading you don’t want to call directly into the package during
startup.  Use a setup similar to this instead:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") #'rg-menu)
     (with-eval-after-load 'rg
        ;; Your settings goes here.
     )

If you don’t want to use the transient menu interface, the following is
needed to achieve lazy loading:

     ;; Workaround for emacs' lack of autoloaded keymaps.
     ;; This is essentially what use-package do.
     (defun rg-autoload-keymap ()
       (interactive)
       (if (not (require 'rg nil t))
           (user-error (format "Cannot load rg"))
         (let ((key-vec (this-command-keys-vector)))
           (global-set-key key-vec rg-global-map)
           (setq unread-command-events
             (mapcar (lambda (ev) (cons t ev))
                     (listify-key-sequence key-vec))))))

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") #'rg-autoload-keymap)
     (with-eval-after-load 'rg
        ;; Your settings goes here.
     )

wgrep
.....

This package use wgrep (https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep) for
editing capabilities in the rg results buffer.  No setup is needed.

Isearch integration
...................

Optional *note isearch integration: 6. can be enabled to allow you to
extend isearch to trigger ripgrep searching.  Enable it in your
configuration with:

     (require 'rg-isearch)
     (define-key isearch-mode-map "\M-sr" 'rg-isearch-menu)

For the evil use case where isearch-mode is exited after first search
hit, users would also want to add the binding to the ‘global-map’ or
similar.

Interaction with the `ripgrep' configuration file
.................................................

The `ripgrep' binary allows using a configuration file
(https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file)
to set default values for command line flags.  This package requires
specific command line flags to function correctly and using a `ripgrep'
configuration may conflict with these requirements.  Therefore the
configuration file is ignored by default.  This can be changed by the
*note rg-ignore-ripgreprc: 7. setting.

     Note: Using the `ripgrep' configuration file may break
     functionality of this package if you are not careful.

Interaction with xterm-color
............................

This package is not written to be used with custom output colors
provided by external packages like `xterm-color'.  It relies on the
color escape sequences so stripping these will break in unexpected ways.
If you are using such packages, the advice is to hook such functionality
into ‘compilation-filter-hook’ instead of advising ‘compilation-filter’.

1.2 Searching
=============

Searching is done by invoking one of the different frontend commands.
This package is built around recursive search based on three parameters;
a single `directory', `file type' filter, and a search `pattern'.  These
three parameters can interactively be selected or figured out
automatically by the package, depending on which command that is used.

The underlying `ripgrep' binary has the file type filter concept built
in.  You have a high level of control over which files to search and
which to ignore.  This is partly what makes it so fast, ignoring
uninteresting files.

In addition to the base parameters there are a lot of options that
control how a search is done.  These are typically selected from the
*note rg-menu: a. interface.

* Menu:

* Case sensitivity::
* Interactive search::
* Project search::
* Do what I mean::
* Isearch search::
* File type aliases::
* The menu::


File: rgel.info,  Node: Case sensitivity,  Next: Interactive search,  Up: Searching

1.2.1 Case sensitivity
----------------------

Considering case when searching is an important feature of any search
tool.  This package gives you a lot of control over how to handle case
sensitive and case insensitive search.  It can be forced to `on' or
`off' and set to `smart case'.  The latter is similar to the `ripgrep'
‘--smart-case’ flag but is not using the flag directly.  One thing to
note about this is that the case insensitive setting controls the
behavior when starting a new search.  In the results buffer the setting
is fixed to `on' or `off' but can be toggled easily with a key binding.
See *note rg-ignore-case: c. customization for the details of the
configuration.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Interactive search,  Next: Project search,  Prev: Case sensitivity,  Up: Searching

1.2.2 Interactive search
------------------------

Two commands implements fully interactive search, where all the base
parameters are selected from the mini buffer.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c s r (rg)

     This command prompts for `query', `file type' and `directory' and
     tries to suggest reasonable default values.  The `query' string is
     interpreted as a regular expression.  Default for `query' is the
     thing at point and for `directory' it is the current directory.  If
     the type of the currently visited file is recognized, the
     corresponding *note file type alias: 10. is suggested as the `file
     type' parameter.

     Invoking this command with the `universal argument' will trigger
     confirmation and potential modification of the *note full command
     line: 11. that will invoke the `ripgrep' binary.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c s t (rg-literal)

     This command works in the same way as *note rg: f. but interprets
     the `query' string literally and not as a regular expression.

     Invoking this command with the `universal argument' will trigger
     confirmation and potential modification of the *note full command
     line: 11. that will invoke the `ripgrep' binary.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Project search,  Next: Do what I mean,  Prev: Interactive search,  Up: Searching

1.2.3 Project search
--------------------

A common scenario is to search through a whole project while visiting a
file in the project.  This essentially means identifying the project
root and use that as the top `directory' when invoking the `ripgrep'
binary.  `rg' supports several ways of identifying a project.  Emacs’
major project packages are supported including projectile
(https://www.projectile.mx/en/latest/), find-file-in-project
(https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project) and builtin
project.el
(https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/project.el).
If none of these are used, the fallback is Emacs’ ‘vc-backend’.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c s p (rg-project)

     Search in the current project.  The `directory' is selected via one
     of Emacs’ project packages while `query string' and `file type' are
     prompted for.  The `query string' is interpreted as a regular
     expression.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Do what I mean,  Next: Isearch search,  Prev: Project search,  Up: Searching

1.2.4 Do what I mean
--------------------

The `DWIM' family of search commands tries to be smart by figure out the
search parameters from the context without prompting.  Thanks to
`ripgrep’s' speed, this allows for new ways of searching by invoking a
dwim command and then `refine' the search from the results buffer.

These commands use the word (with the definition of word depending on
context) under cursor as the `query' string.  The `file type' parameter
is taken from the type of the currently visited file.  If the current
file type can not be identified all file types known to `ripgrep' are
used.  The fallback can be customized with *note
rg-default-alias-fallback: 18.  The `directory' parameter varies between
these commands.

 -- ELisp Command: M-x rg-dwim-project-dir

     Do a `DWIM' search in the current *note project: 14.

 -- ELisp Command: M-x rg-dwim-current-dir

     Do a `DWIM' search in the current directory.

 -- ELisp Command: M-x rg-dwim-current-file

     Do a `DWIM' search in the current file.  The `current file' in this
     context is actually a file `pattern' exactly matching the current
     file name in a search starting from current directory.  Most of the
     time this means a single file but if there are multiple files with
     the same name in a sub directory, those will be searched as well.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c s d (rg-dwim)

     This command combines all the `DWIM' commands to one.  The default
     search is in the *note project dir: 19.  With one `universal
     argument' *note current directory: 1a. is used and with double
     `universal arguments' a *note file search: 1b. is done.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Isearch search,  Next: File type aliases,  Prev: Do what I mean,  Up: Searching

1.2.5 Isearch search
--------------------

Isearch integration is optional and need to be enabled explicitly in
your emacs configuration.  See *note installation: 5. for more info.

This functionality is similar to emacs built in occur package but offers
some additional choices for the search and provides the full
functionality of the rg search result buffer.  When enabled, the choosen
binding can be used from isearch to trigger a menu for extending the
isearch to do a ripgrep search in current file, current directory or
current project.


File: rgel.info,  Node: File type aliases,  Next: The menu,  Prev: Isearch search,  Up: Searching

1.2.6 File type aliases
-----------------------

File type aliases are used in `ripgrep' to filter out the files to
search in.  The `ripgrep' binary comes with a default set of aliases
that can be extended or overridden from this package by customizing
*note rg-custom-type-aliases: 1f.

An alias is a mapping between a name and a list of glob patterns
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%2528programming%2529) matching the
files of interest.  Selecting an alias when searching is done with
completing read of the defined aliases.  It is also possible to enter a
custom glob pattern if there is no suitable alias defined for the file
type.

`rg' defines some internal aliases:

Name                 Meaning
                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     
`all'                all defined types including *note rg-custom-type-aliases: 1f.
                     
                     
`everything'         all files.  No filtering on type is done.
                     
                     
`custom'             used internally in this package for mapping custom glob patterns.
                     

     Warning: Do not use any of the internal aliases in *note
     rg-custom-type-aliases: 1f.  That would interfere with the package
     internal usage.


File: rgel.info,  Node: The menu,  Prev: File type aliases,  Up: Searching

1.2.7 The menu
--------------

The global *note prefix key: 21. may be bound to a transient prefix
command, which means that the key binding will popup a menu.  This
package is using the same popup menu backend called transient
(https://magit.vc/manual/transient) as the magit
(https://magit.vc/manual/magit) package.  If you are familiar with magit
this should feels like home.

The menu is mostly interesting when you want to give specific command
line flags to the `ripgrep' binary.  When you just want to do a quick
search based on the defaults the menu basically acts as a normal keymap.

Pressing the ‘rg-menu’ *note prefix key: 21. will popup the menu where
command line flags can be selected before triggering the wanted search
function.  The menu can be customized via the transient API as usual.
This package contains some shortcuts to directly add a new command to
the menu when defining the command via the *note rg-define-search: 22.
macro.

     (rg-define-search rg-word
       :format literal
       :flags ("--word-regexp")
       :menu ("Custom" "w" "Word"))

The ‘:menu’ keyword in the above invocation will trigger insertion of a
new menu item bound to key ‘w’ with description `Word'.  The new menu
item will be put under the `Custom' group.  This group is not available
in the original menu so it will be created.

The menu can be triggered from the *note results buffer: 23. with the
‘m’ key.  The commands in the menu differs, depending on from where it’s
triggered but the available options are the same.  The menu does not
show all options by default.

The visible options can be controlled by the transient suffix levels
documented here
(https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Enabling-and-Disabling-Suffixes.html#Enabling-and-Disabling-Suffixes).
To modify what is enabled at the default level 4 press ‘C-x l’ to enter
edit mode when the menu is visible.  Then select the option by pressing
the key sequence that activates the option and choose the level 4 for
that option.  It’s also possible to use the transient edit mode for
modifying the overall level of the menu to enable more options at once.

1.3 Results buffer
==================

The results of a search is shown in the results buffer.  This buffer
displays search parameters, the full command line and the output of the
`ripgrep' binary.  It supports basic navigation between search results
editing of the file contents directly from the search buffer and also
modification of the current search.  The results buffer is a modified
`compilation' buffer and some key bindings and functionality is
inherited from the parent and from `grep mode'.

* Menu:

* Navigation::
* Refine search::
* Full command line search::
* History navigation::
* Edit and apply (wgrep): Edit and apply wgrep.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Refine search,  Up: Results buffer

1.3.1 Navigation
----------------

Navigation works mostly as in grep/compilation buffers.

 -- ELisp Command: M-n (compilation-next-error)

     Move to next line with a match.

 -- ELisp Command: M-p (compilation-previous-error)

     Move to previous line with a match.

 -- ELisp Command: n (next-error-no-select)

     Move to next line with a match, show that file in other buffer and
     highlight the match.

 -- ELisp Command: p (previous-error-no-select)

     Move to previous line with a match, show that file in other buffer
     and highlight the match.

 -- ELisp Command: M-N (rg-next-file)

     Move to next file header if the results is grouped under a file
     header (See *note rg-group-result: 2b.).

 -- ELisp Command: M-P (rg-prev-file)

     Move to previous file header if the results is grouped under a file
     header (See *note rg-group-result: 2b.).

 -- ELisp Command: } (compilation-next-file)

     Move first match in previous file.

 -- ELisp Command: { (compilation-previous-file)

     Move last match in previous file.

 -- ELisp Command: RET (compile-goto-error)

     Visit match in file.

If *note rg-group-result: 2b. is enabled, the Imenu
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html)
facility is configured to jump across files.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Refine search,  Next: Full command line search,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Results buffer

1.3.2 Refine search
-------------------

From the results buffer it’s easy to change the search parameters.  Some
bindings toggle a flag while others allow you to interactively change
the *note base parameters: 9.

 -- ELisp Command: d (rg-rerun-change-dir)

     Interactively change search `directory'.

 -- ELisp Command: f (rg-rerun-change-files)

     Interactively change searched `file types'.

 -- ELisp Command: t (rg-rerun-change-literal)

     Interactively change `search string' interpret the string
     literally.

 -- ELisp Command: r (rg-rerun-change-regexp)

     Interactively change `search string' interpret the string as a
     regular expression.

     Tip: *note rg-rerun-change-regexp: 34. and *note
     rg-rerun-change-literal: 33. are used for switching between regular
     expression and literal search.  So for quick switching between
     search modes with the same search string, just press the respective
     key and then ‘RET’.

 -- ELisp Command: g (rg-recompile)

     Rerun the current search without changing any parameters.

 -- ELisp Command: c (rg-rerun-toggle-case)

     Toggle case sensitivity of search.  The state of the flag is shown
     in the `[case]' header field.

 -- ELisp Command: i (rg-rerun-toggle-ignore)

     Toggle if ignore files are respected.  The state of the flag is
     shown in the `[ign]' header field.

     Tip: It is possible to create and bind your own toggle flags with
     the macro *note rg-define-toggle: 38.

 -- ELisp Command: m (rg-menu)

     Fire up *note the menu: a. for full access to options and flags.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Full command line search,  Next: History navigation,  Prev: Refine search,  Up: Results buffer

1.3.3 Full command line search
------------------------------

Some search commands (See *note rg: f. or *note rg-literal: 12.) allow
you to edit the final command line before invoking the search by giving
a `universal argument'.  This can be used to invoke features of the
`ripgrep' binary that is not supported in this package’s interface.
This could be specific flags, searching in multiple directories etc.

     Note: Using full command line search will disable refinement of the
     search from the result buffer.


File: rgel.info,  Node: History navigation,  Next: Edit and apply wgrep,  Prev: Full command line search,  Up: Results buffer

1.3.4 History navigation
------------------------

Each search result is stored in the search history, which is a per
results buffer property.  History can be navigated back and forward, the
forward history is cleared when a new search is done.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c < (rg-back-history)

     Navigate back in history.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c > (rg-forward-history)

     Navigate forward in history.

     Tip: The key bindings here are slightly inconvenient so invoking
     this via *note the menu: a. by pressing ‘m b’ and ‘m w’ is more
     ergonomic.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Edit and apply wgrep,  Prev: History navigation,  Up: Results buffer

1.3.5 Edit and apply (wgrep)
----------------------------

The results buffer supports inline editing via the wgrep
(https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep) package.  This is setup
automatically when `rg' is loaded.

 -- ELisp Command: e (wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode)

     Make the search results editable by enabling ‘wgrep’ mode.  When
     done press ‘C-c C-c’ to commit your changes to the underlying files
     or ‘C-c C-k’ to drop the changes.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Search management,  Next: Multi line search,  Prev: Results buffer,  Up: Usage

1.4 Search management
=====================

The result buffer is named ‘*rg*’ and `rg' reuse the same result buffer
for new searches.  If you want to store a search while continuing doing
new searches there are two ways of doing that.

 -- ELisp Command: s (rg-save-search)

     Save the search buffer by renaming it to a unique new name.  This
     is available both outside and inside a result buffer.  Outside of
     the result buffer it’s bound to ‘C-c s s’.

     If you want to keep all search buffers until manually killed you
     can use this snippet in your init file.

          (defadvice rg-run (before rg-run-before activate)
            (rg-save-search))

 -- ELisp Command: S (rg-save-search-as-name)

     Save the search buffer and interactively give it a specific name.
     This is available both outside and inside a result buffer.  Outside
     of the result buffer it’s bound to ‘C-c s S’.

The default buffer name can be customized with *note rg-buffer-name: 46.
This setting considers dir local variables and it’s even possible to use
a function to get a really dynamic setup.

Having a lot of search buffers floating around can easily get messy.  To
help keeping this under control there is a search manager.  The manager
is simply a modified ‘ibuffer’ that lists all the results buffers, shows
some data about the searches and make it possible to kill of some unused
etc.

 -- ELisp Command: L (rg-list-searches)

     Open the search manager.  This is available both in result buffer
     and globally bound to ‘C-c s l’.

 -- ELisp Command: C-c s k (rg-kill-saved-searches)

     Kill all saved searches except for the one that matches *note
     rg-buffer-name: 46.  This is available both in result buffer and
     globally bound to ‘C-c s k’.

     Warning: If you have a dynamic *note rg-buffer-name: 46. setup,
     only one buffer that matches your current criteria (dir locals or
     project for instance) will be kept.  So be careful when killing
     saved searches to avoid losing important search results.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Multi line search,  Prev: Search management,  Up: Usage

1.5 Multi line search
=====================

By default, ripgrep does matching per line.  The ‘--multiline’ flag can
be used for enabling matching over multiple lines.  This flag is
available in the *note rg-menu: a. as an option.  The ‘--multiline’ flag
does not match new line characters with the ‘.’ as one might expect
though.  A separate flag is used to allow this, ‘--multiline-dotall’.
The casual user of multi line search commonly want this flag on by
default so it’s recommended to add this to *note rg-command-line-flags:
4b. to avoid having to trigger this flag manually from the menu.

See the ripgrep manual page for more info about the multi line flags.

File: rgel.info,  Node: Customization,  Next: Faces,  Up: Configuration

2.1 Customization
=================

Customization is done via the Emacs customization system.  The group
‘rg’ is the main group of the package.

     M-x customize-group [RET] rg [RET]

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-executable [(executable-find "rg")]

     The `ripgrep' executable to use.  Could be an absolute path or just
     the base name if the executable is in the path.  The default is
     using ‘executable-find’ to locate the command.  If you want to use
     this package with tramp it might be better to set it to just “rg”
     in order to let the OS find the binary where it’s invoked.  From
     Emacs 27.1, the tramp use case is by default handled automatically.
     See *note rg-executable-per-connection: 51. for details.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-executable-per-connection [t]

     This setting only has effect in Emacs 27.1 or later.  Handle the
     *note rg-executable: 50. automatically for different hosts if used
     with tramp.  ‘executable-find’ for “rg” binary will be invoked on
     remote hosts to determine the path to ripgrep.  The result is
     stored per connection.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-custom-type-aliases [nil]

     An association list that maps file type aliases to a space
     delimited string with file globs.  These are combined with the
     `ripgrep' builtin file aliases.

     Example:

          (setq rg-custom-type-aliases
            '(("foo" .    "*.foo *.bar")
              ("baz" .    "*.baz *.qux")))

     You may also add lambdas to ‘rg-custom-type-aliases’ to add aliases
     dynamically based on mode, directory, project, etc.

          (add-to-list
           'rg-custom-type-aliases
           (lambda ()
             (when (in-frontend-app)
               (cons "ui" "*.js *.hbs *.json"))))

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-prioritized-type-aliases [nil]

     A list of aliases that are prioritized among ripgrep’s builtin
     aliases when selecting the alias based on the buffer file name.
     This list contains only the alias names and the order between the
     items does not matter.

     Example:

          (setq rg-custom-type-aliases
            '("cpp" "puppet"))

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-default-alias-fallback ["everything"]

     This setting controls the default alias used when no alias can be
     recognized for the current buffer.  ‘all’ or ‘everything’ are
     reasonable values for this variable.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-command-line-flags [nil]

     A list of command line flags that will be appended to the `ripgrep'
     command line.  Must either be a list of flags or a function that
     returns a list of flags.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-group-result [t]

     Controls the layout of the results buffer.  If non ‘nil’, each file
     name is displayed once and matches are grouped under that filename
     instead of repeating the filename on each match.  This is
     essentially the layout of the ‘--no-heading’ `ripgrep' command line
     flag.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-show-columns [nil]

     Controls if column numbers are used in the search result.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-ignore-case [case-fold-search]

     Setting that controls if case sensitive search is made or not.  It
     can essentially be `on', `off' or `smart'.  The `smart' setting
     will trigger an analyze of the search string and if it’s all lower
     case, the search will be case `insensitive', otherwise it will be
     case `sensitive'.  The following values are valid:

        - `case-fold-search' - A non nil value of ‘case-fold-search’
          will trigger smart case behavior.

        - `smart' - Smart case behavior.

        - `force' - Always ignore case.

        - `nil' - Always consider case.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-hide-command [t]

     Hide most of command line by default.  This is enabled by default
     and can be set to ‘nil’ to show full command line.  This can be
     toggled in the results buffer by clicking on the command line.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-keymap-prefix ["C-c s"]

     This variable sets the default prefix used for the global key
     bindings.  Note that ‘rg-enable-default-bindings’ needs to be
     invoked for the bindings to be enabled.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-use-transient-menu [t]

     Controls whether ‘rg-menu’ will be used by default or not.  It’s
     also possible to enable the menu explicitly with

          (rg-enable-menu)

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-show-header [t]

     Controls if the search info header is shown in the result buffer.
     This is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting this
     variable to ‘nil’.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-buffer-name ["rg"]

     Controls the name of the results buffer.  It may be `string' or
     `function'.  This name will be surrounded by ‘*’ to yield the final
     buffer name so if this setting is ‘foo’ the buffer name will be
     ‘*foo*’.  One useful case of using it is to have separate result
     buffers per project.  One can set this variable in ‘dir-locals‘
     file or set it to function.

     Example, this function will set results buffer name based on
     ‘project-current‘:

          (defun my-rg-buffer-name ()
            (let ((p (project-current)))
              (if p
           (format "rg %s" (abbreviate-file-name (cdr p)))
                "rg"))))

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-ignore-ripgreprc [t]

     Controls if the ripgreprc
     (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file)
     file should be ignored or not.  If ‘nil’, the config file will be
     used, otherwise it will be ignored.  The default is to ignore this
     file in order to avoid that conflicting settings have impact on
     this package’s behavior.  Setting this to ‘nil’ may affect core
     functionality of this package.  Especially changing colors can
     affect parsing of the output and result in a broken results buffer.

File: rgel.info,  Node: Position numbers alignment,  Up: Customization

2.1.1 Position numbers alignment
--------------------------------

When operating `rg' in grouped output mode (*note rg-group-result: 2b.
is non nil), it’s possible to control how the line and column numbers
are displayed in the result buffer.

Example settings:

     (setq rg-align-position-numbers t)
     (setq rg-align-line-number-field-length 3)
     (setq rg-align-column-number-field-length 3)
     (setq rg-align-line-column-separator "#")
     (setq rg-align-position-content-separator "|")

Will yield the following format:

     File: matched_file.foo
       1#  2|match1
     888# 10|match2

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-align-position-numbers [t]

     Setting this to ‘t’ will align line and column numbers in columns
     padded with white space.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-align-line-number-field-length [4]

     Defines the length of the line number field.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-align-column-number-field-length [3]

     Defines the length of the column number field.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-align-line-column-separator [" "]

     Separator string used between line and column numbers.  ‘nil’ means
     use default separator from `ripgrep'.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-align-position-content-separator [" "]

     Separator string used between the position numbers and matched
     content.  ‘nil’ means use default separator from `ripgrep'.

===========================

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-enable-default-bindings &optional, prefix)

     Enable the default keyboard bindings for the package with prefix
     key.  If *note rg-use-transient-menu: 55. is on this will enable
     the menu instead of activating the global bindings.  If ‘prefix’ is
     not provided *note rg-keymap-prefix: 21. will be used.

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-enable-menu &optional, prefix)

     Enable the *note rg-menu: a. with prefix key.  This bypass *note
     rg-use-transient-menu: 55. setting.  If ‘prefix’ is not provided
     *note rg-keymap-prefix: 21. will be used.

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-use-old-defaults)

     This function is provided to keep backwards compatibility with
     versions older than 2.0.0.  In this version default settings as
     well as key bindings changed and to bring back the old defaults
     call this function in your init file.

     Functions to call when a ripgrep search is finished.

     Each function is called with two arguments: the compilation buffer,
     and a string describing how the process finished.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-filter-hook [nil]

     Hook run after new content has been inserted in in the rg buffer.
     This hook is called every time the rg buffer has been updated with
     new content and filtered internally by the package.

 -- ELisp Variable: rg-mode-hook [(wgrep-rg-setup)]

     Hook run after entering rg mode.


File: rgel.info,  Node: Configuration macros,  Next: Use with evil-mode,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Configuration

2.5 Configuration macros
========================

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-define-toggle flag, &optional, key, default)

     This is a macro that can be used to define custom `ripgrep' flag
     toggling functions in the result buffer.  The macro takes the flag
     (and potential value) as an argument and optionally binds the
     toggle function to a key.  If ‘default’ is non nil the flag is used
     by default.

     The function defined by this macro will be named as the flag name
     stripped with leading dashes and prefixed with
     ‘rg-custom-toggle-flag-’.

          (rg-define-toggle "-uu" "I" t)

     Creates a function named ‘rg-custom-toggle-flag-uu’ that is on by
     default and bound to ‘I’ in `rg' result buffer.

          (rg-define-toggle "--context 3" (kbd "C-c c"))

     Creates a function named ‘rg-custom-toggle-flag-context’ that is
     off by default and bound to ‘C-c c’ in `rg' result buffer.

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-define-search name, &rest, args)

     This macro can be used to define custom search functions in a
     declarative style.  Default implementations for common behavior is
     available and custom forms can also be used.

     It optionally starts with a string that is used as the docstring
     for the defined function.  The rest of the arguments contain key
     value pairs according to the specification below.  All keys are
     optional with specified default if left out.

        - `:query' - Method for retrieving the search string.  Allowed
          values are ‘point’ which means extract thing at point and
          ‘ask’ which means prompt the user for a string.  Any form that
          evaluates to a string is allowed.  Default is ‘ask’.

        - `:format' - Specifies if ‘:query’ is interpreted literally
          (‘literal’) or as a regexp (‘regexp’).  If it is a form, eg.
          ‘(not current-prefix-arg)’, and is non-nil the ‘:query’ is
          interpreted literally, otherwise as a regexp.  Default is
          ‘regexp’.

        - `:files' - Form that evaluates to a file alias or custom file
          glob.  ‘current’ means extract alias from current buffer file
          name, ‘ask’ will prompt the user.  Default is ‘ask’.

        - `:dir' - Root search directory.  Allowed values are ‘ask’ for
          user prompt, ‘current’ for current dir and ‘project’ for
          project root.  Any form that evaluates to a directory string
          is also allowed.  Default is ‘ask’.

        - `:confirm' - ‘never’, ‘always’, or ‘prefix’ are allowed
          values.  Specifies if the the final search command line string
          can be modified and confirmed the user.  Default is ‘never’.

        - `:flags' - ‘ask’ or a list of command line flags that will be
          used when invoking the search.

        - `:menu' - Bind the command into ‘rg-menu’.  Must be a list
          with three items in it.  The first item is the description of
          the group in which the new command will appear.  If the group
          does not exist a new will be created.  The second item is the
          key binding for this new command (ether a key vector or a key
          description string) and the third item is the description of
          the command that will appear in the menu.

     Examples:

          (rg-define-search search-everything-at-home
            "Search files including hidden in home directory"
            :query ask
            :format literal
            :files "everything"
            :flags ("--hidden")
            :dir (getenv "HOME")
            :menu ("Search" "h" "Home"))

          (rg-define-search rg-emacs
            "Search the emacs lisp source code."
            :dir "/usr/share/emacs/25.2/lisp/"
            :flags '("-z")
            :files "*.{el,el.gz}"
            :menu ("Custom" "L" "lisp"))


File: rgel.info,  Node: Use with evil-mode,  Next: Customizing the menu,  Prev: Configuration macros,  Up: Configuration

2.6 Use with evil-mode
======================

Some key bindings clash with `evil-mode'.  Recommendation is to use evil
`motion' state for the results buffer and then switch to evil `normal'
mode when editing in `wgrep-mode'.  Some adjustments need to be done to
avoid the clashes though.

This is a start of a configuration.  This let `rg-mode'’s key bindings
override the motion state map bindings based on that these motion keys
are not important in an `rg' results buffer.  Adjust this to your
preferred use case:

     (with-eval-after-load 'rg
       (advice-add 'wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode :after
               #'evil-normal-state)
       (advice-add 'wgrep-to-original-mode :after
               #'evil-motion-state)
       (defvar rg-mode-map)
       (add-to-list 'evil-motion-state-modes 'rg-mode)
       (evil-add-hjkl-bindings rg-mode-map 'motion
         "e" #'wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode
         "g" #'rg-recompile
         "t" #'rg-rerun-change-literal))


File: rgel.info,  Node: Customizing the menu,  Prev: Use with evil-mode,  Up: Configuration

2.7 Customizing the menu
========================

The menu can be modified from the emacs configuration file.

To add a new `switch' before the option triggered by ‘-n’ at suffix
level 3:

     (transient-insert-suffix 'rg-menu "-n" '(3 "-o" "Only print matches" "--only-matching"))

To add a new `option' before the option triggered by ‘-g’ at suffix
level 4:

     (transient-insert-suffix 'rg-menu "-g" '(4 "-f" "Pattern file" "--file="))

The ‘=’ in ‘--file=’ triggers argument input for the flag.

To remove an item from the menu specify the trigger key in the transient
remove command.  For example, to remove the ‘Search hidden files’ switch
use the following:

     (transient-remove-suffix 'rg-menu "-h")

Please refer to the transient
(https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Modifying-Existing-Transients.html#Modifying-Existing-Transients)
documentation for details on customizing the menu.

This package also adds a convenience function for appending new
`commands' to the menu in the groups at the bottom.

 -- ELisp Function: (rg-menu-transient-insert group, key, description,
          command)

     This inserts a new command under ‘group’ if it exists, otherwise a
     new group is created.  ‘key’, ‘description’ and ‘command’ is as for
     the ‘transient-insert-suffix’ function.

     For example to insert a new command under ‘Search’ group:

          (rg-menu-transient-insert "Search" "m" "My search" 'my-search-command)

     It’s usually better to use the ‘:menu’ key of the *note
     rg-define-search: 22. macro to define a search function and adding
     it to the menu in one go.

3.1 Pull requests
=================

If you want to submit a patch, please submit a GitHub pull request
(https://github.com/dajva/rg.el/pulls).  If you want to submit any
larger code changes, please create an issue first for discussion.  Some
features does not fit well into this package and there is also good to
agree on the general design before doing any major work.

The minimum requirements for a pull request to be accepted is that all
existing tests pass and test coverage should not decrease.  Often a
patch also needs additional tests, new/changed documentation etc.

Don’t strive to submit a perfect pull request directly.  It’s often
better to submit something simple that shows the main direction of the
new code in order to discuss the best way to proceed and what additions
are needed.

       The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
     software and other kinds of works.

       The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
     to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
     the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
     share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
     software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
     GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
     any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.

       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
     free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

       To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
     these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
     certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
     you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
     freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
     or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
     know their rights.

       Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
     (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
     giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

       For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
     that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
     authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
     changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
     authors of previous versions.

       Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
     modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
     can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
     protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
     pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
     use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
     have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
     products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
     stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
     of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

       Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
     States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
     software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
     avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
     make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
     patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       0. Definitions.

       "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

       "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
     works, such as semiconductor masks.

       "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

       To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
     in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
     exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
     earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

       A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
     on the Program.

       To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
     computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
     distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
     public, and in some countries other activities as well.

       To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
     a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

       An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
     work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
     the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
     menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

       1. Source Code.

       The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

       A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
     is widely used among developers working in that language.

       The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
     than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
     packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
     Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
     Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
     implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
     "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
     (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
     (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
     produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

       The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
     control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
     System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
     programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
     which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
     includes interface definition files associated with source files for
     the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
     linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
     such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
     subprograms and other parts of the work.

       The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
     can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

       The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

       2. Basic Permissions.

       All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
     content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

       You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
     in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
     of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
     with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
     the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
     not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
     for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
     and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
     your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

       Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
     makes it unnecessary.

       3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

       No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
     11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
     similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
     measures.

       When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
     the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
     technological measures.

       4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

       You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
     keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
     recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

       You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

       5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

       You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

         a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
         it, and giving a relevant date.

         b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
         released under this License and any conditions added under section
         7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
         "keep intact all notices".

         c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
         License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
         License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
         additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
         regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
         permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
         invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

         d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
         Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
         interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
         work need not make them do so.

       A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
     and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
     in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
     "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
     used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
     beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
     in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
     parts of the aggregate.

       6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

       You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
     in one of these ways:

         a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
         Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
         customarily used for software interchange.

         b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
         written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
         long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
         model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
         copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
         product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
         medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
         more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
         conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
         Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

         c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
         written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
         alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
         only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
         with subsection 6b.

         d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
         place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
         Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
         further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
         Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
         copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
         may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
         that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
         clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
         Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
         Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
         available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

         e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
         you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
         Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
         charge under subsection 6d.

       A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
     from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
     included in conveying the object code work.

       A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
     or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
     into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
     product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
     typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
     of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
     actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
     is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
     commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
     the only significant mode of use of the product.

       "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
     a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
     modification has been made.

       If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
     part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
     User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
     fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
     Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
     by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
     if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
     modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
     been installed in ROM).

       The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
     protocols for communication across the network.

       Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
     in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
     documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
     source code form), and must require no special password or key for
     unpacking, reading or copying.

       7. Additional Terms.

       "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
     be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
     that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
     apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
     under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
     this License without regard to the additional permissions.

       When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
     it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
     add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
     that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

         a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
         terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

         b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
         author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
         Notices displayed by works containing it; or

         c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
         requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
         reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

         d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
         authors of the material; or

         e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
         trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

         f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
         material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
         it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
         any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
         those licensors and authors.

       All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
     governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
     a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
     License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
     of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
     not survive such relicensing or conveying.

       If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

       Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
     form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

       8. Termination.

       You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
     this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
     paragraph of section 11).

       However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
     holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
     prior to 60 days after the cessation.

       Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
     copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
     your receipt of the notice.

       Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
     this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
     material under section 10.

       9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

       You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
     to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
     nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
     modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
     not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
     covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

       10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

       Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
     for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

       An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
     work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
     give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
     Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
     the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

       You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
     not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
     rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
     any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
     sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

       11. Patents.

       A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
     work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

       A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
     by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
     but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
     consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
     purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
     patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
     this License.

       Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
     make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
     propagate the contents of its contributor version.

       In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
     sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
     party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
     patent against the party.

       If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
     and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
     to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
     publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
     then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
     available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
     patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
     license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
     actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
     covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
     in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

       If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
     or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
     you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
     work and works based on it.

       A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
     specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
     work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
     in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
     to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
     the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
     parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
     patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
     conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
     for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
     contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
     or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

       Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

       12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

       If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
     not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
     to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
     the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
     License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

       13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
     combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
     License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
     but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
     section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
     combination as such.

       14. Revised Versions of this License.

       The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
     Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
     option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
     version or of any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
     GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
     by the Free Software Foundation.

       If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
     public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
     to choose that version for the Program.

       Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

       15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

       THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
     IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

       16. Limitation of Liability.

       IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
     THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.

       17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

       If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
     an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
     Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
     copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
         Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

         This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.

         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
     notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

         <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
         This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
     might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
     if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
     For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
     <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

       The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
     into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
     may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
     the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
     Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
     <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
