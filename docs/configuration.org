* Customization
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: customization
  :END:
  Customization is done via the Emacs customization system. The group
  =rg= is the main group of the package.
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  M-x customize-group [RET] rg [RET]
  #+END_SRC
  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-executable '(executable-find "rg"))
  #+END_SRC

  The /ripgrep/ executable to use. Could be an absolute path or just the
  base name if the executable is in the path. The default is using
  =executable-find= to locate the command. If you want to use this
  package with tramp it might be better to set it to just "rg" in
  order to let the OS find the binary where it's invoked.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-custom-type-aliases)
  #+END_SRC

  An association list that maps file type aliases to a space
  delimited string with file globs. These are combined with the
  /ripgrep/ builtin file aliases.

  Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq rg-custom-type-aliases
      '(("foo" .    "*.foo *.bar")
        ("baz" .    "*.baz *.qux")))
  #+END_SRC

  You may also add lambdas to =rg-custom-type-aliases= to add aliases
  dynamically based on mode, directory, project, etc.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list
      'rg-custom-type-aliases
      (lambda ()
        (when (in-frontend-app)
          (cons "ui" "*.js *.hbs *.json"))))
  #+END_SRC
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-default-alias-fallback)
  #+END_SRC

  This setting controls the default alias used when no alias can be
  recognized for the current buffer. =all= or =everything= are
  reasonable values for this variable.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-command-line-flags)
  #+END_SRC

  A list of command line flags that will be appended to the
  /ripgrep/ command line. Must either be a list of flags or a function
  that returns a list of flags.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-group-result)
  #+END_SRC


  Controls the layout of the results buffer. If non =nil=, each file name
  is displayed once and matches are grouped under that filename instead of
  repeating the filename on each match. This is essentially the layout of
  the =--no-heading= /ripgrep/ command line flag.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-show-columns)
  #+END_SRC


  Controls if column numbers are used in the search result.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-ignore-case)
  #+END_SRC

  Setting that controls if case sensitive search is made or not. It
  can essentially be *on*, *off* or *smart*. The *smart* setting will
  trigger an analyze of the search string and if it's all lower case,
  the search will be case /insensitive/, otherwise it will be case
  /sensitive/. The following values are valid:

  - *case-fold-search* - A non nil value of =case-fold-search= will trigger smart case behavior.
  - *smart* - Smart case behavior.
  - *force* - Always ignore case.
  - *nil* - Always consider case.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-hide-command)
  #+END_SRC

  Hide most of command line by default. This is enabled by default and can
  be set to =nil= to show full command line.
  This can be toggled in the results buffer by clicking on the command line.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-keymap-prefix)
  #+END_SRC

  This variable sets the default prefix used for the global key bindings.
  Note that =rg-enable-default-bindings= needs to be invoked for the
  bindings to be enabled.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-use-transient-menu)
  #+END_SRC

  Controls whether =rg-menu= will be used by default or not. It's also
  possible to enable the menu explicitly with
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (rg-enable-menu)
  #+END_SRC
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-show-header)
  #+END_SRC

  Controls if the search info header is shown in the result buffer. This
  is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting this variable to
  =nil=.
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-buffer-name)
  #+END_SRC

  Controls the name of the results buffer. It may be /string/ or /function/.
  This name will be surrounded by  =*= to yield the final buffer name
  so if this setting is =foo= the buffer name will be =*foo*=.
  One useful case of using it is to have separate result buffers per project.
  One can set this variable in `dir-locals` file or set it to function.

  Example, this function will set results buffer name based on `project-current`:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (defun my-rg-buffer-name ()
      (let ((p (project-current)))
        (if p
            (format "rg %s" (abbreviate-file-name (cdr p)))
          "rg"))))
  #+END_SRC
  :END:

  :OPTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-custom-info 'rg-ignore-ripgreprc)
  #+END_SRC

  Controls if the [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file][ripgreprc]] file should be ignored or not. If =nil=,
  the config file will be used, otherwise it will be ignored. The
  default is to ignore this file in order to avoid that conflicting
  settings have impact on this package's behavior. Setting this to =nil=
  may affect core functionality of this package so make sure you know
  what you are doing.
  :END:

*** Position numbers alignment
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: position-numbers-alignment
    :END:

    When operating /rg/ in grouped output mode ([[opt:rg-group-result]] is non
    nil), it's possible to control how the line and column numbers are
    displayed in the result buffer.

    Example settings:

    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq rg-align-position-numbers t)
    (setq rg-align-line-number-field-length 3)
    (setq rg-align-column-number-field-length 3)
    (setq rg-align-line-column-separator "#")
    (setq rg-align-position-content-separator "|")
    #+END_SRC

    Will yield the following format:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    File: matched_file.foo
      1#  2|match1
    888# 10|match2
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    :OPTION:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
    (rg-custom-info 'rg-align-position-numbers)
    #+END_SRC

    Setting this to =t= will align line and column numbers in columns padded
    with white space.
    :END:

    :OPTION:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
    (rg-custom-info 'rg-align-line-number-field-length)
    #+END_SRC


    Defines the length of the line number field.
    :END:

    :OPTION:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
    (rg-custom-info 'rg-align-column-number-field-length)
    #+END_SRC


    Defines the length of the column number field.
    :END:

    :OPTION:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
    (rg-custom-info 'rg-align-line-column-separator)
    #+END_SRC


    Separator string used between line and column numbers. =nil= means
    use default separator from /ripgrep/.
    :END:

    :OPTION:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
    (rg-custom-info 'rg-align-position-content-separator)
    #+END_SRC

    Separator string used between the position numbers and matched content. =nil= means
    use default separator from /ripgrep/.
    :END:

* Configuration functions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: configuration_functions
  :END:

  :FUNCTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-function-info 'rg-enable-default-bindings)
  #+END_SRC
  Enable the default keyboard bindings for the package with prefix
  key. If [[opt:rg-use-transient-menu]] is on this will enable the menu
  instead of activating the global bindings. If =prefix= is not
  provided [[opt:rg-keymap-prefix]] will be used.
  :END:

  :FUNCTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-function-info 'rg-enable-menu)
  #+END_SRC
  Enable the [[file:usage.org::#the_menu][rg-menu]] with prefix key. This bypass
  [[opt:rg-use-transient-menu]] setting. If =prefix= is not provided
  [[opt:rg-keymap-prefix]] will be used.
  :END:

  :FUNCTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-function-info 'rg-use-old-defaults)
  #+END_SRC
  This function is provided to keep backwards compatibility with
  versions older than 2.0.0. In this version default settings as well
  as key bindings changed and to bring back the old defaults call this
  function in your init file.
  :END:

* Configuration macros
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: configuration_macros
  :END:

  :FUNCTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-function-info 'rg-define-toggle)
  #+END_SRC

  This is a macro that can be used to define custom /ripgrep/ flag
  toggling functions in the result buffer. The macro takes the flag
  (and potential value) as an argument and optionally binds the toggle
  function to a key. If =default= is non nil the flag is used by default.

  The function defined by this macro will be named as the flag name
  stripped with leading dashes and prefixed with =rg-custom-toggle-flag-=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (rg-define-toggle "-uu" "I" t)
  #+END_SRC

  Creates a function named =rg-custom-toggle-flag-uu= that is on by
  default and bound to =I= in /rg/ result
  buffer.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (rg-define-toggle "--context 3" (kbd "C-c c"))
  #+END_SRC

  Creates a function named =rg-custom-toggle-flag-context= that is off by
  default and bound to =C-c c= in /rg/ result
  buffer.
  :END:

  :FUNCTION:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results value raw :exports results
  (rg-function-info 'rg-define-search)
  #+END_SRC

  This macro can be used to define custom search functions in a
  declarative style. Default implementations for common behavior is
  available and custom forms can also be used.

  It optionally starts with a string that is used as the docstring for
  the defined function.  The rest of the arguments contain key value pairs
  according to the specification below.  All keys are optional with
  specified default if left out.

  - *:query* - Method for retrieving the search string.  Allowed values are
    =point= which means extract thing at point and =ask= which means
    prompt the user for a string.  Any form that evaluates to a string
    is allowed. Default is =ask=.
  - *:format* - Specifies if =:query= is interpreted literally
    (=literal=) or as a regexp (=regexp=). If it is a form, eg.
    =(not current-prefix-arg)=, and is non-nil the =:query= is interpreted
    literally, otherwise as a regexp. Default is =regexp=.
  - *:files* - Form that evaluates to a file alias or custom file
    glob. =current= means extract alias from current buffer file name,
    =ask= will prompt the user. Default is =ask=.
  - *:dir* - Root search directory.  Allowed values are =ask= for user
    prompt, =current= for current dir and =project= for project
    root.  Any form that evaluates to a directory string is also allowed.
    Default is =ask=.
  - *:confirm* - =never=, =always=, or =prefix= are allowed values.  Specifies
    if the the final search command line string can be modified
    and confirmed the user. Default is =never=.
  - *:flags* - =ask= or a list of command line flags that will be used when
    invoking the search.
  - *:menu* - Bind the command into =rg-menu=.  Must be a list with three
    items in it.  The first item is the description of the
    group in witch the new command will appear.  If the group
    does not exist a new will be created.  The second item is
    the key binding for this new command (ether a key vector
    or a key description string) and the third item is the
    description of the command that will appear in the menu.

  Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (rg-define-search search-everything-at-home
      "Search files including hidden in home directory"
      :query ask
      :format literal
      :files "everything"
      :flags ("--hidden")
      :dir (getenv "HOME")
      :menu ("Search" "h" "Home"))
  #+END_SRC
  :END:

* Customizing the menu
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: customizing_the_menu
  :END:
  Please refer to the [[https://magit.vc/manual/transient/Modifying-Existing-Transients.html#Modifying-Existing-Transients][transient]] documentation for customizing the menu.
