Contributions are very welcome. Development is done in the [[https://github.com/dajva/rg.el][GitHub
repository]]. If you find a bug, please report it in the [[https://github.com/dajva/rg.el/issues][issue tracker]].


* Pull requests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: pull_requests
  :END:
  If you want to submit a patch, please submit a [[https://github.com/dajva/rg.el/pulls][GitHub pull
  request]]. If you want to submit any larger code changes, please create an
  issue first for discussion. Some features does not fit well into
  this package and there is also good to agree on the general design
  before doing any major work.

  The minimum requirements for a pull request to be accepted is that
  all existing tests pass and test coverage should not decrease. Often
  a patch also needs additional tests, new/changed documentation etc.

  Don't strive to submit a perfect pull request directly. It's often
  better to submit something simple that shows the main direction of
  the new code in order to discuss the best way to proceed and what
  additions are needed.

* Docker
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: docker
  :END:
  Docker can be used to run the tests or generate documentation
  locally without installing dependencies on the host and to test with
  different emacs versions.

  To use docker, just set the =USE_DOCKER= variable when
  running the tests.
  The =EMACS_VERSION= variable can be used to select emacs
  version. Note that dash ('-') is used instead of points ('.') in the
  version numbering. So emacs 28.2 is specified as =28-2=.
  Emacs are installed from https://github.com/purcell/nix-emacs-ci so
  only emacs versions supported in that repository will work.
  - Build docker container:
    #+begin_src bash
      # Don't use the USE_DOCKER variable here
      make EMACS_VERSION=30-2 docker-build
    #+end_src
  - To run all the tests in docker image:
    #+begin_src bash
     make USE_DOCKER=true test
    #+end_src
  - Use a specific emacs version:
    #+begin_src bash
      make USE_DOCKER=true EMACS_VERSION=snapshot
    #+end_src
  - Generate html documentation:
    #+begin_src bash
      make USE_DOCKER=true html
    #+end_src

* Tests
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tests
  :END:
  [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/][Cask]] is used for testing. The tests are written using the Emacs
  built in ERT framework and follows the conventions of [[https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el][ert runner]]
  although ert_runner is no longer used. There are also compilation
  tests, style check, package verification etc.
*** Setup
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: tests_setup
    :END:
    - [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/installation.html][Install cask]]
    - Install all developer dependencies:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      make deps
      #+END_SRC
*** Running
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: tests_running
    :END:
    - Run the whole test suite:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      make test
      #+END_SRC
    - Run only the unit/integration tests:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      make ert-test
      #+END_SRC
    - Manually test the package with Emacs:
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      cask emacs -Q -L . --eval="(progn (require 'rg) (enable-default-bindings))"
      #+END_SRC


* Documentation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: documentation
  :END:
  The documentation is written in org mode. The export target is
  [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html][restructured text]] suitable for the [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/][Sphinx]] documentation
  generator. Sphinx is used to export the output from org mode to info
  and HTML documentation. The resulting .rst files are used for the online
  documentation on [[https://readthedocs.io]].

  The end user documentation is generated after committing to the
  main repository. It's advisable to build
  both html and info documentation locally and verify the output to
  make sure the changes looks as expected.
*** Setup
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: documentation_setup
    :END:
    - [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html][Install Sphinx]]
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      sudo apt install python3-sphinx python3-sphinx-rtd-theme
      #+END_SRC
    - Install makeinfo
      #+begin_src bash
      sudo apt install texinfo
      #+end_src
*** Building
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: documentation_building
    :END:
    - HTML documentation
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      make html
      #+END_SRC
      Open =docs/rst/_build/html/index.html= in a browser.
    - Info documentation
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      make info
      #+END_SRC
      To view in emacs:
      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      C-u M-x info [RET]
      #+END_SRC
      Then select the =docs/rst/_build/info/rgel.info= file.
