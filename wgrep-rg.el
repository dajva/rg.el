;;; Commentary:

;; wgrep-rg allows you to edit a rg buffer and apply those changes to
;; the file buffer.

;;; Install:

;; 1. Install rg.el
;;
;;   https://github.com/dajva/rg.el

;; 2. Install wgrep.el

;; 3. Put this file into load-path'ed directory, and byte compile it if
;; desired. And put the following expression into your ~/.emacs.
;;
;;     (autoload 'wgrep-rg-setup "wgrep-rg")
;;     (add-hook 'rg-mode-hook 'wgrep-rg-setup)

;;; Usage:

;; See wgrep.el
